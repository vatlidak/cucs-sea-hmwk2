## Project structure

* Makefile: Makefile
* include/: Header file for defines
* src/addqueue.c: Implements addqueue command
* src/rmqueue.c: Implements rmqueue command
* src/showqueue.c: Implements showqueue command
* scripts/checkpatch.pl: Format checking script
* tests: contain some test media files

## Notes
* To avoid conflicts for same file names of different users, we append real uid
* Files and directories are created atomically with the use of umask
* A user cannot add in the queueu a file that already exists - maybe we want to
  change this into a heap -- dump -- format.
* Fix installation under "/bin" issue

## Build
* make [build]

## Installation
* make install
* The installation needs root priviledges to:
  - Create a user "print_spoller"
  - Create a directory "/var/print_spooler"
  - Change owner, enable setuid bit, and copy executables under /bin
